# Goddamn Javascript Config

I've had enough with Javascript configs breaking. There's a gazillion modules you need
to get state of the art linting and formatting and they all change versions and break
in various different ways eventually.

This is just one module to install that locks all deps and brings you to latest
babel level and eslint rules with standard (supports prettier) to solve
Javascript config once and for all.

## Quick Start

Two steps to be done with it:

```
$ yarn add --dev goddamn-javascript-config
$ node_modules/.bin/goddamn-javascript-config
```

Last step inits a `.babelrc` and an '.eslintrc' for you.
